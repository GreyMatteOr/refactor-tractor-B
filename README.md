**Project Description**

For this group project, we were tasked with refactoring an existing project. We were asked to utilize a series of technologies, including SASS, fetch and Webpack and rely on testing (including testing with spies) to rebuild an existing application.  We also were expected to refactor our CSS and HTML to be both responsive & accessible.

**Abstract**

A site for recipe tracking where users can select their favorite recipes and choose a recipe to cook for the week. A user is able to see ingredients in their individual pantry and make a shopping list of items to purchase to cook their favorite recipes.

**Installation**

* Clone down the repo at: https://github.com/GreyMatteOr/refactor-tractor-B  
* You can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): git clone https://github.com/GreyMatteOr/refactor-tractor-B.git [what you want to name the repo]
* Then install the library dependencies. Switch into your new directory & run: npm install in the terminal.
* To verify that it is setup correctly, run npm start in your terminal. Go to http://localhost:8080/ in the browser to visit the deployed application.

**Project Goals**

* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process
* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that your DOM manipulation is happening

**Technologies Used**

* HTML
* SCSS
* JavaScript
